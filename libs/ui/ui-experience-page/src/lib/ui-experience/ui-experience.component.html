      I developed a blog for FIEI (Intercultural Training for Indigenous
      Educators), an institution with the purpose of offering specific
      intercultural training for indigenous educators. The blog was designed to
      store and document all team activities, highlight difficulties faced and
      serve as a valuable source of research. During this period, I dedicated
      myself entirely to development, covering both the Back-End and the
      Database. Our API was built using PHP with the Laravel framework, while
      the database was implemented with the help of MySQL, being managed through
      phpMyAdmin.
